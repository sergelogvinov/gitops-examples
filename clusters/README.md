# Clusters

This directory contains the cluster configurations for the different environments.
To create a new cluster, you can copy the `cluster-0` directory and modify the configuration files.

Especially files:
- `fluxcd.yaml` - change path folder
- `kustomization.yaml` - choose the components you want to install
